# Audio preprocessing with AEC support
# Install at least one of the following for AEC functionality:
# - webrtc-audio-processing (recommended, best quality)
# - speexdsp-python (fallback, good compatibility)
# If neither is installed, AEC will be disabled but NS will still work

# Recommended (best AEC quality):
# webrtc-audio-processing>=0.2.0

# Alternative (if webrtc fails to install):
# speexdsp-python>=1.4.0
